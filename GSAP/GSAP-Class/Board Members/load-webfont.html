    //This example shows how to use a custom web font. When using custom fonts it is important to make sure they are loaded before taking any measurements.

    //If you get the offset.top() of elements before the fonts are loaded you may run into problems if the loaded fonts have different heights than the system fonts. 

	//The following code uses Google's WebFont api to wait until the Quicksand font is loaded or fails to load before taking offset().top measurements.
